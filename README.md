# Tech_Bench_Modules

Modules allow additional functionality to be added to the Tech Bench beyond its original purpose.  Each module listed here has been tested and verified that it will work with the Tech Bench application.

## File Link Module

[Github Repository](https://github.com/butcherman/FileLinkModule)

    This module is an extension to the Tech Bench application. It allows users to create file links that will allow guests to either upload files for the user to access, or download files that the user has loaded to the link. Each link has a unique URL to access it, as well as a set expiration date. Once that date has passed, the files in the link are no longer accessible by guest access.

    By using this feature, users can securely pass files to customers that may be too large for emailing or other means.
